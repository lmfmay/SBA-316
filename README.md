# SBA 316: The Document Object Model
## Project description
This project showcases my capability to implement features of the Document Object Model (DOM) in a practical manner.


### The following requirements are part of this assessment:
- Cache at least one element using selectElementById.
- Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll.
- Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).
- Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.
- Create at least one element using createElement.
- Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.
- Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content. 
- Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.
- Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.
- Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.
- Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
- Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.
- Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.
- Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)
- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
- Commit frequently to the git repository.
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
- Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
